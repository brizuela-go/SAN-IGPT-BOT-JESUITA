## PWA 

This is a PWA. Feel free to install it. To achieve this, [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/) is used. 

If you wish to use a different image for the PWA icons, you'll need to run this command:

```bash
npx pwa-asset-generator <your-desired-image> icons 
```

Of course, you'll need to change the `manifest.json` as the next step.
